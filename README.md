# TwitSentimentAnalysis
 The dataset has been taken from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment/home) This is a dataset having tweets about 6 US Airlines along with their sentiments: positive, negative and neutral.  We have two files: ‘Tweets-train.csv” and ‘Tweets-test.csv” The train data contains about 11000 tweets and test contains 4000 tweets. I have performed Sentiment Analysis on the dataset and also built a classifier on the training data.
